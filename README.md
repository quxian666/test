The AIMaaS platform is a "one-stop model service management platform" developed by the Badou AI technical team. It is an integrated model service platform that combines functions such as model deployment and management, model fine-tuning training, and computing resource management. Its goal is to help enterprises quickly realize the privatized deployment and application of large models, support the fine-tuning of professional Q&A knowledge from enterprises or organizations into application models, and accelerate the development of enterprise business intelligence.



**Features include**:

- One-click model deployment: One-click deployment of large language models such as Qwen, Deepseek, GlM, and LLama. You can flexibly set how many graphics cards the model uses to start.
- One-click model start/stop: One-click to start and stop the model.
- Online monitoring of model operation status: View model operation logs online to understand the model's running status.
- One-click model fine-tuning: Quickly perform model fine-tuning training, currently supporting full-parameter fine-tuning, qlora fine-tuning, lora fine-tuning, etc.
- Unified management of multiple computing devices: Supports the management of multiple computing server resources, facilitating the free expansion and management of enterprise computing power.

# Case Introduction

Enterprise privatized model deployment application case: A certain enterprise used the AIMaaS platform to deploy on 3 servers with 6 cards each, using entry-level 2080TI graphics cards for deployment.

Server configuration: 2U, 512G memory, 1T disk. Gigabit routers are used to realize server interconnection.

- Server A: Deploy the AIMaaS platform, add the pre-installed k8s to the AIMaaS platform to manage all computing devices.
  - 4 cards: Run DeepSeek-r1-32b to provide language reasoning services. [Note: 4 cards of 2080TI are recommended for no more than 10 users. You can upgrade to 4090 graphics cards to improve concurrency and session response speed]
  - 2 cards: Run Qwen2.5-vl-7b to provide image recognition reasoning services
- Server B: (AIMaaS platform node service, just add the pre-installed k8s to the AIMaaS platform for management)
  - 4 cards: Run Qwen3-32b to provide language interaction services
  - 1 card: Run Bge-large*, a vectorization model
  - 1 card: Run Bge-rerank model
- Server C: (AIMaaS platform node service, just add the pre-installed k8s to the AIMaaS platform for management)
  - 2 cards: Run Qwen2.5-14b to provide language services for question classification, simple problem handling, tool calls, etc.
  - 4 cards: Used for model fine-tuning training, supporting fine-tuning of models below 7b and 14b. [Note: Depending on different training parameters, the time cycle may be relatively long. However, if it is only in lora mode with a small number of rounds, you can perform light fine-tuning on the model to enhance its ability to answer key business questions and self-cognition ability]

The services started through the above configuration can be integrated into Dify, Fastgpt, RagFlow, and n8n for integrated application services.
For example:
You can quickly build applications such as intelligent customer service and intelligent creation through workflow reference.

# Pre-Environment Configuration
To deploy the AIMaaS platform, it is recommended to have a server with independent computing power, and the recommended configurations are as follows:

- 1. Entry-level experience version
     A server with 2 CPUs, 12G memory, 1T disk, and 1-N graphics cards. It is recommended to have 2-4 graphics cards; if not, at least 1 graphics card of 2080TI or higher.
- 1. Professional training version
     More than 2 servers, with each server configured as: 2 CPUs, 512G memory, 2T disk, 4-8 graphics cards. It is recommended to use graphics cards such as 3090, 4090, A100, L40 or higher configurations.

Recommended operating systems: centos7.9+, Ubuntu20+ or higher.


# Quick Start

- ## Image one-click deployment and service startup method

  Note:

  - 1. Need to install docker and k8s-1.22.17 first.
  - 1. You can start downloading the image and starting the service through the following commands.
  - 1. The 8080 port can be modified. Note: Optional, you can directly modify -p 8080:8080 -e BASE_URL=127.0.0.1:8080.
  - 1. The default access path is [127.0.0.1:8080/badouai-maas/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/badouai-maas/)
  - 1. Initial account and password: aimaas/aimaas2025
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e BASE_URL=127.0.0.1:8080 crpi-wfhl7cyuhi65rl7p.cn-guangzhou.personal.cr.aliyuncs.com/fadsii/badou-aimaas:1.0
```

- ## Source code startup method


```python
git clone 
# Initialize and run the frontend
cd webroot
npm install --registry=https://registry.npm.taobao.org
# Start the service
npm run dev
 
# Initialize and run the backend (return to the project root directory)
cd badouai-maas-platform
mvn package 
# Place the project in the webapps directory of Tomcat running on port 8080
# After successful operation, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/badouai-maas/#/
```

# Demonstration

## Demonstration: One-click model deployment process

Shows the entire process from "selecting a model" to "starting the service", including version selection, resource configuration (CPU/GPU), deployment confirmation, and a prompt for successful startup.

## Demonstration: Online model fine-tuning operation and effect comparison of fine-tuned models

Shows how to upload fine-tuning datasets, configure fine-tuning parameters (learning rate, number of iterations, etc.), start fine-tuning tasks, and check real-time training progress.
